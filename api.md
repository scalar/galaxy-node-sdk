## `Planets`

### Get all planets

It's easy to say you know them all, but do you really? Retrieve all the planets and check whether you missed one.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetListAllDataParams`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |
| Response | [`PlanetListAllDataResponse`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |

```ts
const listAllData = await client.planets.listAllData({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
});
```

### Create a planet

Time to play god and create a new planet. What do you think? Ah, don't think too much. What could go wrong anyway?

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetCreateParams`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |

```ts
const planet = await client.planets.create();
```

### Get a planet

You'll better learn a little bit more about the planets. It might come in handy once space travel is available for everyone.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |

```ts
const planet = await client.planets.retrieve(1);
```

### Update a planet

Sometimes you make mistakes, that's fine. No worries, you can update all planets.

| Direction | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Request | [`PlanetUpdateParams`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |
| Response | [`Planet`](./src/resources/planets.ts) |

```ts
const planet = await client.planets.update(1);
```

### Delete a planet

This endpoint was used to delete planets. Unfortunately, that caused a lot of trouble for planets with life. So, this endpoint is now deprecated and should not be used anymore.

```ts
await client.planets.delete(1);
```

### Upload an image to a planet

Got a crazy good photo of a planet? Share it with the world!

| Direction | Type |

const celestialBody = await client.celestialBodies.create({
  name: "",
  type: "planet",
});
```

## `Authentication`

### Create a user

Time to create a user account, eh?

| Request | [`AuthenticationCreateUserParams`](./src/resources/authentication.ts) |
| Response | [`User`](./src/resources/authentication.ts) |

Yeah, this is the boring security stuff. Just get your super secret token and move on.

| Response | [`AuthenticationCreateTokenResponse`](./src/resources/authentication.ts) |

Find yourself they say. That's what you can do here.
